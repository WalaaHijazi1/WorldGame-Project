"""
This game will use the free currency api to get the current exchange rate from USD to ILS, will
generate a new random number between 1-100 a will ask the user what he thinks is the value of
the generated number from USD to ILS, depending on the userâ€™s difficulty his answer will be
correct if the guessed value is between the interval surrounding the correct answer

Properties
1. Difficulty
Methods
1. get_money_interval -Will get the current currency rate from USD to ILS and will
generate an interval as follows:
a. for given difficulty d, and total value of money t the interval will be: (t - (5 - d), t +
(5 - d))
